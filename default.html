				The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs found along the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity. The left kidney is located slightly higher than the right kidney because the right side of the liver is much larger than the left side.
			</div>
			<div id="bdot1-2">
				The ureters are a pair of tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. The ureters are about 10 to 12 inches long and run on the left and right sides of the body parallel to the vertebral column.
			</div>
			<div id="bdot1-3">
				The urinary bladder is a sac-like hollow organ used for the storage of urine. The walls of the bladder allow it to stretch to hold anywhere from 600 to 800 milliliters of urine.
			</div>
			<div id="bdot2-1">
				The brain has two sides called hemispheres, and they are different in size, shape, and the roles they play. Within those divisions lie others. These hemispheres have areas, called lobes, which perform specific functions.
			</div>
			<div id="bdot2-2">
				The 1st thoracic nerve is one of thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves that originate from the spinal cord and the uppermost of the twelve (12) thoracic nerves of the torso. Although spinal nerves do not have individual names, they are grouped according to the level from which they stem, and each nerve is numbered in sequence. 
			</div>
			<div id="bdot2-3">
				Primarily, this section of the peripheral nervous system sends and receives signals regarding locomotion of the body. Some of the impulses are sent from various parts of the brain and spinal cord; some come from sense organs located in the joints, ligaments, and tendons; and some come from the muscles themselves.
			</div>
			<div id="bdot3-1">
				Food begins its journey through the digestive system in the mouth, also known as the oral cavity. Inside the mouth are many accessory organs that aid in the digestion of food—the tongue, teeth, and salivary glands.
			</div>
			<div id="bdot3-2">
				The pharynx, or throat, is a funnel-shaped tube connected to the posterior end of the mouth. The pharynx is responsible for the passing of masses of chewed food from the mouth to the esophagus.
			</div>
			<div id="bdot3-3">
				The esophagus is a muscular tube connecting the pharynx to the stomach that is part of the upper gastrointestinal tract. It carries swallowed masses of chewed food along its length. 
			</div>
			<div id="bdot4-1">
				All lymph nodes have the primary function of the production of lymphocytes, which help defend the body against microorganisms and against harmful foreign particles and debris from lymph before it is returned to the bloodstream.
			</div>
			<div id="bdot4-2">
				Peyer's patches (or Peyer patches) are round or ovoid bundles of lymphatic tissue made up of unencapsulated lymphatic cells that protect the mucous membranes of the small intestines (the ileum) from infection.
			</div>
			<div id="bdot4-3">
				The pancreas is a large gland located just inferior and posterior to the stomach. It is about 6 inches long and shaped like short, lumpy snake with its “head” connected to the duodenum and its “tail” pointing to the left wall of the abdominal cavity. 
			</div>
			<div id="bdot5-1">
				The heart is a muscular pumping organ located medial to the lungs along the body’s midline in the thoracic region. The bottom tip of the heart, known as its apex, is turned to the left, so that about 2/3 of the heart is located on the body’s left side with the other 1/3 on right.
			</div>
			<div id="bdot5-2">
				The subclavian artery runs under the clavicle; hence the name subclavian. The subclavian artery runs into the axillary region where it becomes known as the axillary artery.
			</div>
			<div id="bdot5-3">
				The pulmonary circulation transports deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs, where the blood picks up oxygen and returns to the left side of the heart.
